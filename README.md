# Waligorski
A Python code to compute the energy radial profiles of the deposition of Swift Heavy Ions in GaN using the Waligorski equation (Waligorski 1986). The code can easily be implemented for other materials by changing the material parameters in the Waligorski.py. 

The jupyter notebook test.ipynb exemplifies the use of the Waligorski.py for two Swift Heavy Ions.
